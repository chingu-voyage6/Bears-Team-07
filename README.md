# Workflow and Setup

-  We will be using https://github.com/Chingu-cohorts/voyage-wiki/wiki/ProjSetup-Git-Workflow

If you get a message like this when performing a `git pull`.
```
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> development
```
You can do `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> <branch>` change the `<branch>` to the name of the branch you are trying to pull from.

# Define MVP

Project Name: *DearDiiary*

For this voyage we are going to work on the MVP. The main idea of the MVP is to have an application that helps us visualize life events and milestones happening as part of our daily life using a timeline to record the dates. It will have different types of posts for each user.

We are going to use:

MEVN Stack:
- M ongoDb: Database
- E xpress: Backend Framework
- V uejs: Frontend Framework
- N odejs: Backend Main Language / Ecosystem

Frontend Library:
- Bootstrap4

The main features are:

- User Sign Up/Sign In
- Fully Responsive
- Home page with timeline
- User profile page
- One click addition/deletion - story, quote, image upload, text
- Update image and text
- Favorite a post

"(Bryan Carl Chug, 2013) In the midst of social networks and fast-paced everything, people tend to lose themselves. Have you ever forgot when and why you last made that pivotal decision in your life? Have you ever feel like you're just always on-the-go and trapped in the present, never able to remember and cherish moments from the past? Have you ever asked yourself "what am I doing?", and "where am I supposed to go from here?"? Here is an app that could help you remember who you were and who you are, by collecting and cherishing personal & private moments. You get to rate your highs and lows throughout your life. It's a personal diary app that helps you get in touch with someone so near yet so far, yourself."
